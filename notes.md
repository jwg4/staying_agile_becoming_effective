'If you think you can fly, why not take off from the ground first?'

---

The bone-headed way to collaborate without spending a lot of time co-ordinating is simply to silo everything so that only one person knows about it. Of course, you are just deferring communication and co-ordination until one of the following things happen:
 * Someone leaves.
 * There is an emergency or a complex failure involving things that two or more separate people know about.
 
It's obviously suboptimal to do all your knowledge transfer during either of these two situations.

This situation is a local maximum - to get out of it you have to do a lot of work catching up with documentation and proper organization. The global maximum is one where there are
 * Clear boundaries, not between what people do, but between what different parts of the system do. Thus it is clear exactly in what ways a given component can or cannot be changed. Equally, given a change, it should be somewhat obvious what component needs to be changed.
 * A process which can modify these clear and clean boundaries, in a transparent and responsive way.
