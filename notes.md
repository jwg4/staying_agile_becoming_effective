## Thinking about your development practices

We all know what a programmer looks like when she is working. Head tilted away from the screen with eyes closed,
or frantically scribbling a jumbled diagram involving lots of arrows on a piece of scrap paper.
This is for lots of us, the time we do our real work, the thinking time when we come up with algorithms, data structure,
or code architecture, before sitting at the keyboard and dumping the ideas to disk.

Now replace 'programmer' with software developer. The modern software developer doesn't spend anything like the same amount of
time designing data structures or protocols. She is using out-of-the-box solutions to many of these problems.
Does her working time look like the programmer's, on the rare days she needs to build something from scratch, and like
a busy bureaucrat's, constantly tapping away to join all the pieces together in a pre-ordained way on all the other days?

No. If anything, she needs more thinking time than the 'programmer'. Making a workable system out of components and services
requires, if anything, more deep and careful thought than writing individual pieces of code. The software developer
needs more thinking time, not less. But what is she thinking about? The answer is given in this chapter,
and can be summarized by the one word *process*.
