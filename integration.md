# Integration and deployment testing

Integration testing, staging deployments, and test deployment, are all key to an agile way of working.
They are essential for automated deployment and continuous delivery - would you automatically deploy updates
if you didn't first know both that the code would still work in production, and that the deployment was 
likely to succeed? For teams doing traditional software development in large organizations, moving to
continuous delivery is a matter of breaking down tasks into much smaller changesets, and speeding up and 
smoothing out the deployment pipeline to move those changes out quicker.

In practice, many small teams working for closed userbases, manage frequent and fast deployment of small changes
without either extensive testing or automated deployment. So what can be added by agile practices and continuous
delivery techniques?
