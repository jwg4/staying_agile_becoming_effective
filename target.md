## But we're not doing Waterfall!
A lot of writing about agile software development is presented in opposition to something called 'Waterfall', which is 
a traditional methodology for developing software, based on a [paper by Winston W. Royce][waterfall].

[waterfall] This paper, Royce, Winston (1970), "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems" (PDF), Proceedings of IEEE WESCON 26 (August): 1â€“9, actually presents what it calls 'Waterfall' as an example of an overly rigid development process. The paper tries to suggests ways of improving the process, by including shorter feedback cycles around different steps of the process. It contains some ideas which seem related to agile practices. It's not clear why a methodoloy which was criticized in 1970 for not being agile enough is still used as the example with which modern agile techniques are contrasted, except, possibly, that it was adopted by many large organizations developing software in the intervening years.
